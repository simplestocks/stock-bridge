1) have some section that tracks your trades that you take or you give it in the room because i always know about a trade after its almost done or you say something to manage - 

2) have some swing stock trades ideas and alerts that you find from your scanning or your expertise 

3) have 2-3 stock intraday trades so people like me dont have to deal with options spreads where i can actively manage but it is easy to manage stock trade with stop loss and target order "
