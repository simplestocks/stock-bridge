2) have some swing stock trades ideas and alerts that you find from your scanning or your expertise

My challenge is that I often have my attention split due to work issues, so it is very difficult to latch onto the quick trades.  Also the ConferenceCall tool isn't too great for scrolling back to try and see what trade ideas have been posted.  

Would like to see some sort of way to show focus on longer or swing trades.  Could adding a discord thread for Trading Room items possibly work?  I realize that would only benefit discord subscribers, but I would find it very useful."

I know it is third-party, but I use this tool, it or similar ones could be useful for you to share swing trades in the live session and also follow up on them. https://optionstrat.com/C1DFUg3KdksO 

These are just suggestions. In general, I really enjoy the room and all the information and knowledge you share. Even when I am working without trading, I just listen to the room in the background (Kind of live market updates).

I don't have any suggestions. I think the variety is pretty good and we have to work with what we get. I have switched over from doing mostly options to trading the futures. I have been getting burned a lot less due to time decay. I'll go back to 0DTE options when I feel more comfortable with them but I have found I lose more than I make with them. I find the days when you are traveling and someone else hosts to be valuable to get new perspectives and thoughts.
