1) have some section that tracks your trades that you take or you give it in the room because i always know about a trade after its almost done or you say something to manage - 

2) have some swing stock trades ideas and alerts that you find from your scanning or your expertise 

3) have 2-3 stock intraday trades so people like me dont have to deal with options spreads where i can actively manage but it is easy to manage stock trade with stop loss and target order "

","Yes, perfectly","Flexible — depends on the setup","Yes, I'd love variety","I love the idea of themed sessions. It would be awesome if on certain days just a couple hours were set aside to specifically focus on the various strategies you, Climber, & Raghu use. For example: financing a trade out in time by using a credit put spread/ when & how to know what the best way to execute this kind of trade setup would be. I just asked Climber this exact question on discord but having you lead a thorough live discussion would be so beneficial rather than just practicing in my paper account & trying to gain the confidence on my own to actually apply to my trades. Just a thought.  :) Thanks for all you do! "

The live room is fantastic.

My challenge is that I often have my attention split due to work issues, so it is very difficult to latch onto the quick trades.  Also the ConferenceCall tool isn't too great for scrolling back to try and see what trade ideas have been posted.  

Would like to see some sort of way to show focus on longer or swing trades.  Could adding a discord thread for Trading Room items possibly work?  I realize that would only benefit discord subscribers, but I would find it very useful."
